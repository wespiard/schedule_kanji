# Schedule Kanji (Anki add-on)

This is a barebones Anki add-on that is currently intended for personal use, e.g., there's no real documentation. I will, however, jot down my currently use-case in case anyone ever finds a use for it. 

Currently, I have two main Anki decks for Japanese. One mainly for kanji ([Jo-Mako's Kanji](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1162394272)), and one for vocabulary ([Kaishi 1.5k](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1196762551)). 

The reason for the add-on is that I found myself coming across kanji in the vocab deck that I hadn't yet learned in the kanji deck. So I would manually copy the kanji, search the cards in that kanji deck (if they exist and I'm not already learning them), and then set their due date to "0" so that I start learning them immediately.

All this add-on does is automate that process:
- highlight kanji while reviewing vocab deck
- right click and choose "schedule selected kanji" option from context menu

Currently, I don't use the "production" kanji deck, so I only have it schedule cards from the Recognition/Memrise sub-decks.
